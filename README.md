# Node.js Application Repository

This repository serves as a starting point for building Node.js applications using JavaScript and TypeScript. It provides a foundation for working with MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases and includes support for the Prisma and TypeORM ORMs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version X.X.X)
- MongoDB (version X.X.X)
- PostgreSQL (version X.X.X)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git](https://github.com/TabotCharlesBessong/NodeJsApplications.git)
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ````bash
   cd your-repo
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

#### MongoDB

1. Make sure MongoDB is installed and running locally or update the connection string in `config/mongodb.js` with your MongoDB server details.

#### PostgreSQL

1. Make sure PostgreSQL is installed and running locally or update the connection options in `config/postgresql.js` with your PostgreSQL server details.

### Usage

- Start the application:

  ````bash
  npm start
  ```

- Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

The repository follows a typical project structure for a Node.js application:

- `src/`: Contains the application source code.
- `src/controllers/`: Contains the application controllers.
- `src/models/`: Contains the application models.
- `src/routes/`: Contains the application routes.
- `config/`: Contains the configuration files for MongoDB and PostgreSQL.
- `tests/`: Contains the application tests.

## Technologies

The repository utilizes the following technologies:

- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.
- MongoDB: NoSQL database for data storage.
- PostgreSQL: Relational database for data storage.
- Prisma: Modern database toolkit and ORM for Node.js.
- TypeORM: Object-Relational Mapping library for TypeScript and JavaScript.
